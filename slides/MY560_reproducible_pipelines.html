## Welcome!

Today I am going to offer you a **highly opinionated introduction** to reproducible pipelines for social science in `R`. 

--

What I present is not **right** -- there are **many routes** to reproducibility, and in fact many people will disagree with what I say. That's ok! 

--

What we will do today:

1. The **lecture** bit: I will talk for a while
2. The **fundamentals** bit: We will do a guided git / coding session
3. The **practical** bit: You will work on a data science project and generate a reproducible pipeline

--

What you will need for the session: 

1. A github account
2. `R` and either RStudio, VSCode, or similar IDE installed

The repo for the workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/ddekadt/MY560_reproducible_pipelines_R). Fork and clone to follow along (if you don't know how to, that's ok!).

## Welcome!

Who am I (and who am I not)? 

--

I am an applied social scientist with some experience in **academia and tech**.

--

I am **not** a computer scientist! I am also **not** a developer!

--

I will present this from the perspective of an applied researcher who works extensively with (sometimes large scale) data, not from the perspective of someone writing `R` packages, nor someone writing production-ready code. 

--

What I will present is **introductory**. This is a fast moving space, and **everyone** has opinions about 'best practices.' I find this quite overwhelming myself, and try to use the old photographer's maxim: 'The best camera is the one you have with you.'

--

I hope you will use this material as a starting point for your own exploration of reproducible workflows that **work for you**.

## A Typical Workflow

Let's define a typical workflow for data-intensive social science as a **pipeline**:

--

1. Ingestion: Acquire and read in raw data
2. Transformation: Turning raw data into usable data
3. Analysis: Extracting meaning from the usable data
4. Output: Format and produce results (tables, figures)
5. Reporting: Putting the results into paper/slides

Note: In the data/analytics engineering world the first two parts of this are called an **ELT** (extract, load, transform) or **ETL** pipeline. 

--

A few key things to note about such pipelines:

--

- Process is **long** in temporal and code terms.
- Many **decision-points** throughout.
- Many **dependencies** between steps.

## Why Should You Care?

Some things to note: 

--

- Captain had 20,000+ flight hours, 4,800 on the A320 
- First officer had 10,000+ flight hours, 2,400 on type. 
- Captain had flown into San Francisco many times.

--

Experts **make mistakes**!

--

- Stressful conditions `\(\rightarrow\)` errors
- Fatigue `\(\rightarrow\)` errors
- Teamthink `\(\rightarrow\)` errors
- Mental models + confirmation bias `\(\rightarrow\)` errors

--

Repeat after me: "I will **never be mistake free**."

--

Instead, focus on **error prevention, detection, and mitigation**

---

## Errors and Dishonesty in Science

The **same dynamics** are at play in scientific research:

--

- Academia is high-stress `\(\rightarrow\)` errors (and even dishonesty) 
- Academics get project fatigue (mental and physical) `\(\rightarrow\)` errors
- Team science is hierarchical `\(\rightarrow\)` errors (and misbehaviour)
- Mental models + confirmation bias `\(\rightarrow\)` errors

--

Scientists **make mistakes** and sometimes misbehave. Much of this happens in the **pipeline**.

--

A few different flavours (non-exhaustive): 

1. **Technical** errors: mis-specified analyses, mis-implemented analyses, mis-coding data, etc.
2. **Reasoning** errors: forking paths, unconscious p-hacking, mis-reporting results, etc.
3. Actual **dishonesty**: fabricating data, manipulating data, massaging results and specifications, etc.

---

## Before We Run Through Motivating Examples

**Do not be pejorative** (for the most part)!

--

Be like the airline industry: Handle errors (e.g. Canada 759) with a **bias toward non-pejorativeness**. 

--

For example, to this day the identities of the pilots of Air Canada 759 are not publicly known!

--

If we accept that **everyone makes mistakes** (they do), don't judge harshly those whose mistakes are 'exposed.' 

--

Instead, learn from the mistakes that are surfaced, and do so with **humility and empathy**.  

--

There are **definitely errors in my own work** (I've caught some, but I've surely missed others). All we can do is **keep trying to improve**, and keep learning from each other.

--

A quick TW: The first paper I'm going to discuss studies sexual violence.

## Our Goal 

Use the principles and practices of **reproduciblity** to **(1)** reduce errors in our science, **(2)** practice transparency, and **(3)** make our lives a bit easier. 

These goals becomes increasingly salient in team science settings. 

--

**Goal 1**: Improve our handling of errors
- Prevention: Control opportunities for mistakes
- Detection: Find them when they happen
- Mitigation: Fix them (and downstream dependencies) **properly**

## Our Goal 

Use the principles and practices of **reproduciblity** to **(1)** reduce errors in our science, **(2)** practice transparency, and **(3)** make our lives a bit easier. 

These goals becomes increasingly salient in team science settings. 

**Goal 2**: Improve and encourage transparency
- Force ourselves to think about what we are doing
- Encourage us to be wary
- Let others check what we have done

--

**Goal 3**: Make our lives a little easier
- Reduce stress and labour
- Have archives ready to go
- Automate our workflows

# Reproducibility

## Reproducibility vs. Replicability

What exactly is reproducibility and how does it differ from replicability (which often gets most of the attention)?

--

.pull-left[
### Reproducibility:
- 'Can I **reproduce** your **workflow**?'.
- Goal: Integrity of the pipeline.
- Using **your** code and data to reproduce your **results**.
- Code that is:
  - Comprehensible
  - Traceable
  - Testable
]

--

.pull-right[
### Replicability:
- 'Can I **replicate** your **study**?'
- Goal: Accuracy of the science.
- Using **new** code, and possibly data, to re-conduct your **study**
- Replicability relies on strong reproducibility...
- ... without it, people don't know what you did!
- But replication is more expansive than reproduction.

## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)

Our ultimate goal is to produce what are sometimes called **reproducible analytical pipelines** (RAPs) for our work.

--

What constitutes a RAP?
- Public: Can be reviewed by pretty much anyone
- Comprehensive: End-to-end, includes all inputs, produces all outputs
- Interpretable: Can be understood and executed with minimal effort by you and by others

--

If at the end of the day your typical workflow has some approximation of **these three features**, you are doing **very well**. 

--

It is a good idea to implement the principles of a reproducible workflow **early** in a project, because (good) journals increasingly require them. By the time you all are fighting for tenure it will already be **standard practice**.
---

class: left, top

## The Reproducibility Hierarchy

Ultimately, we want a **RAP (or codebase)** which is: 

1. Code-based, structured, 'firewalled'
2. Documented, version-controlled
3. Functional, modular, DRY, tested
4. Literate, results-automated
5. Dependency-proof in terms of: Packages, Changes, Computing Environment
6. Fully automated

--

If you get to **Tier 1** or **Tier 2**, you are doing **better** than very many (most?) academics.

--

But at a minimum, try to get to **Tier 3**. It's really great if you can get to **Tier 5**. In academia we probably don't usually need to get to  **Tier 6**, but can be valuable in production settings (think back to ELT pipelines). 

--

Note: There is a trade-off between investing in these technologies and productivity. **Choose your balance wisely**.

# Reproducibility in `R`

## 1. Code, Structure, Firewalling

Key principles of the first tier: 

--

1. Code-based: Everything you do should happen with code. There are some situations where this is not possible (e.g. manual transcription of data). But code should take over **as early** in the pipeline as possible.

2. Structure: Keep your project folder **hygienically** and **logically** structured.

3. Firewalling: This is a **non-negotiable** -- there must be a **code-based firewall** between your raw data and any data you analyse. 

---

class: left, top

## 2. Version Control

The most common version control tool used by social scientists is `git`. Some of the **basic steps** in the **git workflow**:

1. `git init`: create a new git repo
2. `git clone [repo path]`: create local copy of repo
3. `git pull`: fetch latest version of remote repo
4. `git status`: check status of local repo
5. `git add .`: propose a change
6. `git commit -m "Informative message"`: commit a change
7. `git push origin`: push a change to the remote repo

You might also encounter **branching** (which is conceptually separate):

- `git checkout -b [branch_name]`: create a separate local copy of repo and move to it
- `git checkout main`: move to the pre-branch local version
- `git merge [branch name]`: merges the changes in the branch into main
