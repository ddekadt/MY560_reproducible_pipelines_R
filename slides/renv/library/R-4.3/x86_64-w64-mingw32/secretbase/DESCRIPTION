Title: Cryptographic Hash and Extendable-Output Functions
Version: 0.5.0
Description: Fast and memory-efficient streaming hash functions. Performs direct hashing of strings, raw bytes, and files potentially larger than memory, as well as hashing in-memory objects through R's serialization mechanism, without requiring allocation of the serialized object. Implementations include the SHA-256, SHA-3 and 'Keccak' cryptographic hash functions, SHAKE256 extendable-output function (XOF), and 'SipHash' pseudo-random function. The SHA-3 Secure Hash Standard was published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2015 at <doi:10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202>. The SHA-256 Secure Hash Standard was published by NIST in 2002 at <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf>.
