Title: Fast and URL-Safe Base64 Encoder and Decoder
Version: 1.4
Authors@R: c( person("Michel", "Lang", NULL, "michellang@gmail.com", role = c("cre", "aut"), comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-9754-0393")), person(NULL, "Apache Foundation", NULL, NULL, role = c("ctb", "cph")), person(NULL, "Free Software Foundation", NULL, NULL, role = c("ctb", "cph")) )
Description: In contrast to RFC3548, the 62nd character ("+") is replaced with "-", the 63rd character ("/") is replaced with "_". Furthermore, the encoder does not fill the string with trailing "=". The resulting encoded strings comply to the regular expression pattern "[A-Za-z0-9_-]" and thus are safe to use in URLs or for file names. The package also comes with a simple base32 encoder/decoder suited for case insensitive file systems.
